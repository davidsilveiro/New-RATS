# rough-auditing-tool-for-security

I've honestly fallen in love with this tool, and that I think is one of the reasons I'll be trying to bring a fresh perspective and design in. Haven't decided yet on the name. I'd still like to pay respect to the original developers, so it'll have RATS in alongside something. Hmm.. early days :)
